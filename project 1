# Project 1 
In this project, I aimed to determine mushroom edibility based on visual and olfactory characteristics, investigating factors like cap size and odor type. 
Three machine learning models—logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests—were employed to identify the most accurate predictor. 
The results, emphasizing correctly classified mushrooms, provide practical insights for applications such as food safety and foraging practices.
